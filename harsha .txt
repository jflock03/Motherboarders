Some talk from my company
Depends if I don't fall asleep in the next hour
Alright lemme know

4-year-ago me got this shit figured out :v
hahahaha

So much for that

Can I get your Netflix account?

Not right now, but later

Probably tomorrow when I remember that you asked me to check this video out

You can go pok√© hunting tonight without me... went on a 12 mile bike ride...

Of course

I was waiting to see who'd do this before you guys left the apartment
There goes my daily PoGo farm for the...

A shit didn't think about that

I was really planning on coming over tonight...then this rain happened...

Give me a heads up of you're still planning on goint
Rain not gonna last

I was actually gonna ask u for grocery/booze shopping tonite

But we can do that tmr

In place of the "Treasure Hunt"
Yeah sure we can get stuff
Or whatever they are calling
Lol good plan

We can go treasure hunting for food
ok
Do you want to come with me and Jon for a movie at 5?
I'll pass. Next week maybe.
Vokay boss
Ffs

Why the fuck why
Why she cut her hair...?
Why all of em did
Who is all of them

What did they do

What is happening
face palm

Let me rephrase

Why do girls cut their hair and effectively downgrade themselves from a 8.5 to a 5.7?
That I do not know

And I actually have strong feelings against it

But she ain't mine, so I can't do anything...

But you're potential ones both have short hair now
Even if she were yours

Yeah

Fuck shit fuck
If she was mine there would be a very long conversation happening
Obligatory
Well shit Duc, what's happening to your potential love lives... there going down from an 8.5 to 5.7

Not argument there
On a brighter note, Humble Bundle's offering $15 for Sid Meier's Civilization V	$30NBA 2K16	$60Mafia II: Digital Deluxe	$40Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel	$40and*Battleborn*	$60	(released May 3)
Well I'm quite literally bankrupt after paying off my medical bills, and I still have more Coming

Message me when you're playing CS
Now actually

PoGo l8r More lures
Okay I'll join in like 10-15 mins... reduce the damn TV volume

Oh...

Interesting

New video out by soviet
Damn...I just called Hillside and they said I could move in Monday. If only I could move in tmr we could have had the entire apt for the _party_

What time do you usually go to work?
Well damn

Why?
Nah scrap that

We could move in after you're done with work

I was thinking if I move in tmr I could ride with you to Waverly, drive back, spend the day move as much stuffs as I can and we can move the rest when I pick you up in the afternoon

But that plan fell thru it seems
Well we can do that, I don't care... why did it fall through?
I can't move in tmr yet

Monday
Oh yeah... duh

Well alright, time to start getting your shit packed up

Did you get the keys and what not?

Also do we want to join A and Bre for the movie at seven
I'm thinking

Considering
Well if not we can go to the later one or Waterloo theatre

Let's do 7 at Waterloo, they have it playing in the dream lounge chairs

Well now that I think of it, we can do the drop me, move stuff and pick me up plan on Monday...

Movie at 7, I'll come at 6:20
Cool

I'm tidying up the room a bit

if you have $1 in quarters that'd be great
Well you started early

Yeah there's some in the car and I have a box of coins in my room, I'll stop by quick and get it
it's too fucking hot

I took the afternoon off
I'm in the room just casually sitting and not creeping on you...hopefully you don't have a heart attack when you wake up

I think alcohol keeps me up... it's like my caffeine

And for some reason, I have body pains
I woke up at 10, made some pasta so I'd have some food in my stomach, then conked out until now
If you'd still like to start shifting, I can come on my lunch break and move a load to the house and you can drop me off and do the same. And then in the evening, me and Jon can get the van and a trailer to start moving the couch, the bed and tables and all.
I just called them and they wont be ready for me until 2

so I'll get the keys and we can start moving after you get done with work
Alrighty
I need the Reese's address
2318 Greenwood Avenue..

Why?
Nvm

Scrap that i don't need it anymore
Well it's there if you need it, just let me know if you're going to be using it so I can let them know

I'll be home in the next 30 mins... text me when your ready and I'll see when Jon is ready
Can you come to ROTH?

Fuckers gave me a key that doesn't work

Im going back there
Yep

I'll be there in like 25-30 mins
The new key works

117 F street
Be there in 3-4 mins
So basically just grab anything you can. The tv box is in the supply closet next to the bathroom. The bean bag chair and the computer desk is good to go.
Yes boss
Rdy when u r
Just took my shower... I'll head over soon
Take your time
On my way
Roughly when shld I start driving to pick u up?
I'm going to say like 3:45-4
It's. So. Fucking. Hot.
Make sure the AC works please
I might just take a nap

Goddamn

All's left at HV are uncategorized shit
And wake up in time, RIGHT?

Wasn't that all that was left even yesterday

Oh your clothes and all were there

I remember I remember

Okay I'm done...I'm not getting anything more done... you might as well start your journey to come pick me up

Please tell me that you're not dead asleep!!
Eh

I thought u said 4

So I set the alarm to 4

I'm coming 
I'M. DYING. IN. ALL. THIS. UNPRODUCTIVITY. AND. SLEEPINESS
Im at that roundabout

North entrance
Coming
We have Internet

We had a shitty splitter and cable so we got virtually no signal
hahahaha

Im remembering when you said, this cable looks so good
Well i was right

That's why the tv works

Not the router

We used a shitty black cable for the router
Alright alright

hahahaha

Oh okay
#notracist
I thought it was the other way round

Round 1 goes to the white

#NotRacisitAsWell
Bad news is we can't change the wifi ssid or password

Doing so requires subscriber info
Why not?
Which i believe is DoR
Oh... I guess that kinda makes sense then

Im still trying to get over black and white and interracial jokes right now
I'm glad we didn't discuss this in public

might get shot
hahahaha
#alilracist
I don't think you're wrong there

Or just keep Russel around for a body shield when bullets start flying and then mourn for his loss and then make a joke about how we don't have to keep seeing him and then the other goes, "too soon dude, too soon"
I'm not so sure abt that

he's alr haunting UNI rn
hahahaha

So there's no getting away from him eh
why do you think we shld graduate asap =))

well, to get jobs n shit

but also Russel :v
Motivation to get a job is moving away from Russell
very true

did you talk to Jon abt the vacuum and the tv stand?
I talked to him about the TV stand... he said he doesn't know what he's upto in the evening, but if he's free he can come. I showed him a picture and he thinks we can fit that in the car
Ivy?
I'll send a message to Carol about the vacuum

Yep
ok

our afternoon is kinda packed

1. Grab the rest of the stuff from HV and vacuum / clean 2. Drop me off back at Hillside to give A her stuffs3. Grab the tv stand4. Walmart
Alright then... I'll get off as soon as possible. Workday is pretty packed as well.I've got 3 meetings for the day left and update report on my current project
yeah I'll leave you to it
Someone fucked up while putting my application in Production so I have to find a way to correct it whatever the fault is

So I'm thinking right now it may be a lil after 4

But we'll see
yup

A said she'll come at 5-530

we'll see
Alrighty
last thing

"According to our records, the contract that you signed had the wrong date. Instead of signing a 2017 contract, we had you sign a 2015 contract. The first pages of the contract state that it is a 2016-2017 contract, however the last two page where you signed state that the contract ends May 31 2015."

just got an email from Hillside

goes well with the "why are people around me always fuck up" theme we're having today
I don't know if I'm laughing cause I find this funny or because no one can do the o e job that they are supposed to do

You're on your own with A, I'm getting off work a lil late, just got a new project and need to sit and discuss

I'll get the vacuum cleaner and come

Bryant has a meeting set up for which I'm attending apparently it at 5:15PMSo on my way I'll drop off the vacuum and then go there...After that I'll give Jon a call and he'll get the van and come over there and pick up the desk and then drop off at Hillside and then get that there and we can go to Walmart
Cool

So ive gathered all of my stuffs

But i can't get the vacuum cleaner

To work

Also

Apparently they dont want the tv stabd that we have rn

So...

Found it
I got the shower stuff... Where you at
The tvs
Sleep is hitting me like a damn wrecking ball trying to take me down
Yup

Am wandering around campus while waiting for hv office to open
Needless to say, you're playing P-GO eh
I'd be a zombie if i am not

There is a guy named Oldguy919 driving a golf carts all around campus taking gyms :))

He is, in fact, old

Checked out from HV

Manager's words when I mentioned the missing keys

"dont worry honey ya good"
Everyone should try to aim to be him

Well that's good news for you

Did she say, who lost the key?
Idk

I turned in my key then so that's prolly why

Goddamn it

Wtf was Kristi doing at ITC

She went "He's alive!"

Which ofc means "you'll be dead soon"
Bwahahahahahha.... Yeah she did that to me too. I played it cool and talked my way out of getting any work from her
Me too

I swiftly diverted to asking her abt Jorge
hahahaha

I feel like that's the safest option of getting oyt
ahaha

the microwave's MC's :v

i know for a fact he didn't buy it

lol he just fb msg'd me

if you have my microwave pls bring it to [his new address]

worst case scenario: we have to look for a different microwave and this one goes to the dumpster 
Or we can hide it in our backyard if he comes looking and he'll be gone and we'll still have it

And I may have found a bed
just the frame or with mattress?
With the mattress
$?
0
lol

gitit

we prolly need Jon...again tho

damn
Yep

We're outside
My mom wanted to go on a lil vacation when im back

And insists on inviting H

running
And these best mom of the year that just made her son cringe so hard that he might have puked on the inside goes to......
somehow she still believes that H and I can work things out...

I briefly considered telling her I alr had a new gf...
You should tell her that you've moved on from that alphabet and onto the next one

Nope...you don't, you have a potential one
there is no J in the VNese alphabet...
Well whatever sounds like J then

Use GI
holy shit

G-H-I-J
Didn't see that coming

Well there goes my theory on skipping letters for you
there is still a K between J and L
You can take "mine"
nope no thank you

absolute savage
And they say one man can't start a war
I think I should volunteer for at least a few of those...

start work day a lil later...

also Sasha is an RA?!
Yep

Bender Hall
she gon die...

esp when it's Bender
Just keep your phone display always on and then keep it in your pocket and do the tour. Prolly can hatch them eggs
lmao 
She gonna find out
Hold on ppl there's a Lapras nearby I gotta catch this brb...
Hell Yeah
I swear if I get a group of all hs kids playing PoGo...

Or I could be like "I will take anyone here from Team Valor"

we gon conquer this bitch
Both team Red and Yellow walk towards you
Now that I think about it

that could be our latest UNI selling point

in a 10 minute walk you have 4 gyms and 20+ pokestops

you cant have that shit at ISU
hahahaha

But will it be a 10 min walk then?
if you dont catch anything in between yeah

otherwise more like 15
We're going to be losing a lot of kids on tours starting this semester

They just wander off cause they find a spearow
potentially

"On your right we have McCollum Science Hall, we have a polar bear and two alligators..." "Yeah yeah yeah can we reach those pokestops from our class?"
True that
Sm fcker alr taking our Lang gym 
Well that was fast
So i was walking around when this random (faculty) guy asked me "Do you need help finding anything?"

I almost went "yeah, this bulbasaur has been on my radar since forver"

Then I realized that might not be what he meant by "find something"
Him: Can I help you find something You: This Bulbasaur Him: Right this way (takes you to Bulbasaur's location)\ UNI Feedback: The staff and faculty are very kind and helpful, they go out of their way to help the students find what they need to be successful

So I can't find the app... I haven't searched a lot, but since you already have it, just send me the API if you still have it or tell me the name of the file or give me it's location
I'm so glad I didn't sign up for tour today
That boring eh
that hot
Lol
at least yesterday was cloudy and cool
It's going to be hot in Thursday too

Just checked

Friday will be cooler

Also it might rain on Thursday
I have half a mind to make some excuses for tmr
Going out of town....?
"I have a doctor appointment for color blindness"

Totally legit
That's a thing right
It can be if I want it to be 
Idk what I prefer

Tour group that doesn't talk

Or tour group that asks too much my throat's drying up from answering

The latter, obviously
hahahaha

That's my kinda group
One of the dads was poGoing the whole way

Look at all these PokeStops

Then his wife hit him
PoGo dad for the win

hahahaha

Typical
It's too fucking hot tho

This polo does not breath. At all

I might just go home after lunch
Lol.. that hot huh

And today is the coolest day of the week
Probably, but with mouth drying up and me trapped ib this Hazmat suit (I feel)

Its like a desert
hahahaha

Hazmat suit, I'm going to remember that one
Holy shit

There's Pokemon on Netflix?!
You didn't know!!!???

We can watch it together if you'd like

I already watched all of it, but I don't mind watching it again

I'll probs be singing the song and everything...become the small kid that I am
fuckin hell

I still have all those Star Trek to watch...
The old ones??
as much as I can, probably
I'll wait patiently
storm's coming

looks like alien invasion from the apt
That's the kind of weather you make some hot chocolate, and sit back and watch TV

At least for me

Storms a brewing

I just remembered, Suicide Squad releases today
Lol

Perfect weather eh
I sware, I love this weather. I'm casually sitting out and enjoying the weather. They have other guests and all of them are talking

#ImNotAntiSocial
Yeah well as long as you're not stuck in the rain i think everyone can enjoy thia
Yep

Say what do you think about movie later in the night

I checked the timings

They have late night shows as well
Sure

Im still at the laundry facility
hahahaha
Waited half an hour for some fuckers to show up taking clothes out of washer
Are you "stuck"
What do you think smart ass

Its fine tho

Watching dota

Praise ITS for installing 2 computers here
We're going to have dinner in a bit, but if you get super bored, message me. I can head over
Yup

what time is the movie?
There ones that start at 9 acts go on
not gonna lie,  I just finished dinner, so fucking full, and _might_ pass out any minute now
Also before 9:20

All time low

I can hear your message pings... That's how quiet your room is

I don't feel too good, you can go without me
ok...

you're ok tho?
Yeah, I'll wake up again in like an hour
kk

get sm more sleep

I still have all 5 gyms
Now you're just making me feel bad
U could drive by n grab sm of them

Every one but the Campanile

Lang gym is full
Took 3 of them with drive bys
I saw a Dratini (the 1x evolved one) over at the Dome earlier. Drove 3 laps all around the parking lots. Nothing.

Then I saw a Pikachu on the way to WRC just now.

Tour's starting in 10. Im legit depressed rn

And by "saw" I mean it appeared in my Nearby

Its silhouette.
I'm pretty sure the temp at work is like 75, but I sware I'm just shivering here, I feel like I'm at 30 or 40 degrees

I caught a beedrill
Oh shit

Do you have a cold?
I don't know... Massive headache and then the chills
yup sounds like a cold
But I don't want a cold!!
Yet you caught one :)

Congrats 

Siraj Acharya "Can we get pic though Please"

new cringelord in town 

8/5/16, 12:00 PM - Duc Vu: I lost so hard at "Please"

you up?
What you upto?
Just chilling here

Heading to Campanile to take a gym and stretch my legs
give me a heads up when the coast is clear

Well I'm back in the apartment and there's no sign of you

Give me a list of those PTC accounts and the password
if you use them to scan in waverly they'll detect

coz the avatar'd teleport 40 miles back n forth in a minute
Fair enough
U home?
Yep

Ssup
Few things

1. Charge your phone

2. Found your battery pack yet?
Yep
3. Pick me up near the gym by CBB at abt 5 45

4. Take a picture of the fridge board so we can go to walmart
I have a meeting for ISA from 5:30 to 6:30
Oh lol
At sidecar
K ill PoGo while waiting for u then
I can give you the car keys and you can go shopping and come back, and then after I'm done we can start farming and then go hunting

How's that for a plan
How abt dinner?
We can do late night, or I'll just buy us some sandwiches from sidecar

Whichever

Or hell we can do a drive through when we're hunting
That works 

K send me the shopping list

See u in 30
Alright...
Which brand of cereal?
Anything

You're still shopping??
Yea
Alright, I just got done

Lemme know when you're heading back
you up?
Yes, I am up
I know who the morning neutralizer is

Motherfucking water bottle guy

Oh lol that wasnt zen

Coz its yellow
Schweinsteiger (if I got the spelling right) has been offered to Juventus
lol

I'm surprised they didnt just include him as part of the Pogba deal
It almost feels like they're just saying, here, if we haven't compensated enough, we'll even give you a good player
nah they won't give him away for free

and they bought him for 6.5 mil so it's not that big a deal

with Pogba United's having way too many MF :v
I wonder how many are going to have to keep taking a seat
Mata, Blind, Rojo,...

Ill prolly leave work early in an hour. Maybe take a nap. If im still sleeping when u get home wake me up and we can go to the 4 45 show
Alrighty
u up?
Yep

Facebook it

Can't see images on WhatsApp

Okay make me some PTC accounts and send them my way...
I don't rmb if I had put the pork stew out for thawing. Do that when u get home (if i hadn't done that alr)

I'll be back in a few...after collecting more pokeballs

hahahaha

Try to get the bike from Alia (and Jon) soon

there's a loop of ~3 miles

that'll net us all 10 gyms

:)
Alrighty... I'll get on it

Make me those accounts...

The meeting that I'm in is soooo boring
denhatanhhung denhianhhung detamanhhung detuanhhung denguanhhung delucanhhung dethatanhhung debatanhhungdecua nhhungdethapanhhung ---- pw nxhfr58e

let me know if those work

I wrote a python script to create them :v
I can't access it through the wifi. Also do these accounts have to be logged in and then accept the tetma and stuff?
Pretty sure they do
Ready when you are
I just realized that Russel could deduce from your fb post that you live with me now and not MC.

Otherwise he's dumber than we thought 
Dumber
I AM SPRINTING

OUT OF WORK

scanner picked up an omastar

near our apt

like wtf!
Fuck me

Why does it happen when we aren't in our house!!!!!!

Go get it
we have 2 eggs left

How the actual fuck

Blu guy here

Heading to Lang

Looping back after

Brenda 3103593540(6)

Where r u?

Whenever u r ready

Library closing in 15
I swear, waking up early  shouldn't be allowed on weekends

The game kicked me out...and I can't even get in now
Get in the game?

Or the gym?

Magikarp same spot

Wigglypuff a block away on main. 14 mins
We lost the CBB gym
Train these 2. Wiggly. Seerley. Reclaim campus.
There's a bunch of blue team guys going and taking the gyms now
Lol sure we'll neutralize them at night

Also taking gyms at 1pm is just plain stupid

Hope they like getting roasted

How's the check up?
Good... 90% healed up
Gr8 

U going to work after that?
Already at work...

Bored and ready to sleep

I might take an early day today
like home-after-lunch early?
hahahaha

Don't worry about cooking... I'll probably crash

Woke up at 5:30 again

Saw your notes

And then just went back and did nothing
so you didnt get the gyms? :))

also arent we getting ice cream and having dinner at piazza?
Well I left the house at like 7:15

So couldn't get it by then

And yes we're getting ice cream...

I thought we'd be waiting till like the first week of classes for actual food at the dining centers
hmm so we

are just gonna drop off the ice cream after they have dinner
That was the plan in my head

Tell Felix to tell those kids not to have desert and then we come in and save the day
well if you can figure a way to catch em all (like Pokemon)
haha

Well we have the flavor list and we have to get eggs anyways

So we can go to hyvee maybe and stock up

Buy a bag of ice and put it in the cooler and then put all the ice cream in there
well you can do all that then pick me up at CBB

then we can go to hyvee

what time should you be back? sounds like you need ample napping time :v
Well do I want it, Yes Do I need it, not really

I'll send you a massage after I get my life figured out
*if you get... 
You're not completely wrong there

Can you call Brenda and yell her that we'll come get the couch tonight at like 5 PM
Yell?

That seems rude 
Yeah you know like shout in the phone

Well she has your couch
"Bitch we coming to take your shit!"
More like, "Please step off bitch, Thank You"

That way we're not too harsh
She didn't pick up

I'll try again later

She will be home
Wonderful
So what's the plan? We need 1) the SUV to get 2) the sofa, then hyvee for 3) ice cream. Also 4) i need to cook, kinda want to PoGo earlier tonight
I'm still waiting for the damn car, should be here soon. Get car, get sofa, give car to Bryant for a while, get groceries, head to the group, give ice cream, come back eat and then pogo
"Come back eat"

Nigga u wut? 
And eat
Eat what?
Umm whatever you cooks

Or whatever foods we get
I can go with you to get the sofa n groceries then I will be back to clean n cook while you give the kids ice cream

Come back eat
Why am I giving the kids the ice cream....

You're the elder one
Cos bitch you can't cook 

Or won't cook 
Fair enough, I'll give the kids the ice cream,and come home and eat

By which time you better have my dinner ready
Sure 

Also

Whose SUV r u waiting for?
Sai's
N who has it rn?
Some Pakistani
K. Please come rescue me as soon as you have it

I didn't know the orientation sessions r in CBB

Brenda just called me
On my way there
Most of them were alr gone. Fuck it imma just head home. We could dump this with Danusha and she could give them out at breakfast or sth
Your call
Yeah im still in a general pissy mood so prolly best to avoid talking to ppl
Kay

Tell me what the joke is that she sent

And we can do something nice when I'm back
No problem, just hoped everything was ok. Maybe you got jacked or something. You probably will going back though when all the jealous people see your new furniture

Weird sense of humor, but ok

Will you need me to pick you up from Bryant's? Im heading out to nuke some gyms
I'm heading to pointe west
K omw
Where you at
Im here. Just making sure you're not hiding behind a bush or sth
Did you decide to go to work
Nope im cleaning the apt

No-shoe-inside policy is now in effect
Alright...

haha

I wonder how long that's gonna last
That's not a challenge you fucker

Damn I blame Anna for our liberal usage of that word
I blame her too

How is she...maybe I'll send her a message

Nah...you can find out and tell me
"hey how are you"

?

That sounds weird
"I'm fine"
-- End of conversation -
Wouldn't be

Surprised

Also side note, I'm thinking about growing my hair long
do you have a good reason for that?
Umm... Do I need to?
Not really, but I was hoping you had one
Also second side note, my chocolate pudding is sugar free.... FML

Well I can come up with one if that'll make you happy
By growing your hair would you look more like an idiot? 

#ripformatting

*Y
haha
Fucking whatsapp
And *N

Reason: Since I want to surprise my mom, just go completely looking like a new person...
Then nah don't do that it's a bad idea

just make sure she wouldn't call the cops on you
Well I'm sure she won't... I'll probably reach in daytime...so go surprise her and then immediately go get a haircut... Much cheaper in India

Okay well then you give me a reason to grow my hair long
make sure you pay the barber extra when you get that hair cut :v

he might just bring out the lawnmower

when the acid kicks in...
Why... He'll probs be thanking me that he got to cut soo much hair
motherfucker invented the dab at 2:06
Varma: I just watched the whole video twice and showed it to my colleagues...  I haven't watched or heard that song in years

Then sb took it away...again :))
Who would have thought that one would be so competitive
Its the most drive-byable

Maybe second after J's Homestyle
Did you really have a magikarp run away?
Yep. Motherfucking magikarp

A minute left
You're killing me with suspense.... Just get it already
I feel like a movie's bad guy waiting to detonate a bomb just to have Superman flies down and rekt everything at the last second
You know once in a while the bad guy also wins
Like just now

I have an idea

But might be too dark 

1) get a Grim Reaper costume

2) stand outside the retirement home near Roth

3) hold up a sign that reads "You're next"
I sware the calls that those old people kids will get.... I'm sure the kids will throw down whatever they're doing and run over to check on the old people
"I swear there was a Grim Reaper outside my window" "Yeah sure take your medication Grandpa"

Also campus gyms are yellow

Well, _were_ yellow
You gotta be careful though... Someone takes a picture then your gonna be on the news and what not

So I think I'm going to have you pick me up after all... Tomorrow at like 1, same place and this time, get my badge. I'll remind you tomorrow

I think im done with AI hw1
Well that was fast
I got the runtime down to 0.04s avg

I think that's good enough
That's pretty fast isn't it
When you get to it...

Combinatorics help a LOT

Cut runtime by 99.99‚ÑÖ
Well it'll take a lot more than that for normal minds to get it
So apparently other people also are having app crash with grimer and muk üòÇ

Esp those with older devices

Sth with the "dripping" model of them not being rendered properly...

Mfw Grimer and Muk are OP now 
FML

Where are you

I'm thinking about going home, getting something to eat, chilling for a while and then play tennis and then come back and do drugs

Could have possibly told me you know
Same thing happened yesterday

Im concerned 
No you're not
Yes i am For myself

Captain CP 10 was asking me....

I'm pretty sure I gave him the ELI5 edition, he still got confused
I dont see how he can be confused by your algorithm

eli5 literally says list out all paths and find the shortest that has G
That is exactly what I said

Are you taking the car out tonight or can I take it for tennis practice?
Yeah take it

I couldnt find my phone...

Calling?
Yep... It rang and then went to voicemail
Well the case has my ID

so they'll know whose that is

or I can lose both 
Yeah it keeps ringing...

Maybe the comp lab...?
Didnt even go in there
In the math building!!
Nah i played po go after that
Campanile spot?
Found it

union
Do you need to get picked up

Or you can use this as an excuse to spend more time with her
Who?

Check out the itc gym
You're top

What's new

I got into coding for Poleksic class and then played and then read for religions and then had breakfast while watching Friends. Safe to say, sleep is staggering to come at me. I think i will give in. So enjoy your day, there's bread and I bought milk(because I got very hungry okay)

Oh and remind me to tell you something about Jehad (Jihad) when I'm up

Hey, can i take the car on the morning... I need to be at McLeod by 8, I'll park the car near the ramp before my 9am... And then you can get it to the career fair if you're going, I'll wake to McLeof from CBB after class and then we can head back together for Combinatorics

All of this only if you're attending the fair
Yea sure
You PoGo-ing??
Where tf is the car?

Im skipping Combinatorics
B lot by Campbell...

Skipped it because I was still talking with people

My phone didn't buzz at all when you sent the message

Did you come to the fair..?

I'm getting free food
Still at the fair

Free food?

I think I'm heading home

Unless you're done soon

Oh shit!

J's mom knows my name 
Shit just got real

So cowshit asked me if I did the Poleksic's quiz....and then just ended it over there
Huh?

9/19/16, 3:28 PM - Duc Vu: So what got real?
You and J

Mom knows your name
I don't know hers...
So I might need some Combinatorics help... Mainly just trying to understand the question more than you showing me how to solve the question
Got half the pizza...

Staying on campus. Let me know when you're done so you can pick me (and the pizza) up
okay boss... You're lucky there's pizza

I'm leaving tennis, where do you want to meet up
Still in the library. If you wanna head home I could go to Lang gym
I'm at Lang gym...

Going for free food??

I'm in the library....
Heading there
You still there?
I got back like 5 mins ago...

Didn't attend, I was doing some Biz Apps stuff and then came home

I just sent that to you so I can get it online through WhatsApp
Because email doesn't work

Task is print out sth like this

I swear, these kids,....
Wait I don't understand... How is that difficult... Like I don't get that part
"How many rows do I have"BS "x"

"How many stars do I have in row 1?" "1"

"How many stars do I have on row 2?" "2"

"How many stars do I have on row i?" "Um, i?"

"Well...?" "I knew that, but Idk how to write it..."

Fuck me...
Tell me this isn't that idiot of a guy... Indian Ask It All
I'd prefer this types of idiocy

Ask It All's type of idiocy is nesting 3 for loops and conjure up Satan and wondering why it doesnt work
haha

"conjure up Satan"... Lost it completely
might have overexaggerated with Satan...

sorry Satan...

but the 3-level nested loops are true story

only one in the lab that had the audacity to try that...
Worse case just fucking print it so it looks like that, who the fuck even thinks about 3 nested loops
no they can't hard-code it lol :v

user-input height of triangle
But seriously 3...
and I went "why didn't you add another print("*:") at the end

and they tried that

and it worked (ofc it did)

their faces... 
All hail the Duc master
If it's stupid but it works it's not stupid

What's the name of that trashy looking chick you were talking to outside of AI

she's also the CS dept office student assistant I think?
Umm lika or Liza or something
I went to talk to Diesburg "Some of the students were frustrated that they knew what to do, they just dont know the syntax to implement that"

"Well, sometimes it's a good thing to be frustrated because if you cant handle that, CS might not be one for you"

haha

Almost as savage as McCormick
Isn't implanting thoughts into code pretty much the nutshell definition of CS

lol
They got the step-by-step algorithm...

I think that's more important than put that into codes

but ofc some of them r at total loss
Well looks like you're doing a good job!!
This bitch is complaining in the lab

"I don't like programming. It's tedious. Can I go to a CS stream where there's not too much programming?"

I'm trying so hard not to snap with "Have you tried the non-CS stream?"
lol

See why I would still be getting a kick out of all of this

I think I'm gonna start making my way home. I have to do a listening exercise for soundscapes
Wait You alr left?
Yeah... I'm like a min away from home
Txt me when u r ready
I'm ready I guess

Tennis is cancelled, I'm going back to take a nap
Saa's pride crying at Campanile
I came to the library, cause the net is down at home. I'm doing a test, and I'll get down at close to 4-4:20. Let me know if you still want to come to the Reese's
Net's working fine for me. Can you fill the bike's tyre? It's by Wright.

Nigga has free wine n shit...

Did Schafer give back exam 1
Yep...
Hw2?
He'd rather wait to give it to you personally...his words

I got 35/50

Thought I would do better :/
Yeah i think it's required by law

Not the 35/50 
Yeah...
Did he talk abt hw2?
He did give HW2...told us to do it using a tournament method

I think he's explained it on the assignment part
The ticketing/lottery system

?
Ummm it's more or less like that yeah...

Maybe it is that and he just used different vocab
No I got that...but since everything is pretty much random

I can't know for sure whether i got it right

I'll ask him tmr

Is it too suspicious tho?
Yep.. "Read up on the assignment, and I'll be ready to answer your questions on Wednesday"

His words

So I think you'll be fine
Ask questions on Wed...
Yep
Not "have a working program n just need to fine tune on Wed" üòÇ
He knows your a freaking smartass so you'll be fine

I'm home till about 5:45. Lemme know of you need anything

Me too

I have exactly zero energy

Plan is head home cook eat and sleep before 9

I like that plan

I just don't know if that last part will happen though
Do you have your keys?
Nah, I got the bike

Just...
Cook some rice. 3 cups will do.

There's still some wings in the fridge

And a couple slices of pizza
I'll cook more when I'm back

"Maybe the pressure has got to you buddy. Don't worry it happens to the best of us... ...let alone the worst.

I realized it's a tall order to tell me *not* to call people out in public...

I mean damn back then I got elected for calling someone out in public...

Kowshit is the type of nigga that goes to a buffet and be like "Look there's chicken! Look there's noodles! Ooh Lobster...!" then starves by the end of the night.

Also Kristi is still here, her travels got cancelled

Nah man...what am I for, I'll be your alibi I'll make 18 other people also vouch for you... Go ahead and murder him
I missed out on a Snorlax because I was going helping one of the student for her Intro Homework üò≠üò≠üò≠

Hey I have tennis tonight, but tell me if you want the car. I'll just use the bike

What's up
I need a few things (in order of importance) 1. Food (Chicken with tofu in the fridge, rice in the cooker) 2. The speaker 3. If you can find the library locker key somewhere in my room...
Is that all??
I guess...
Food, I'll get it. The speaker will be there by the time the meeting starts...and I'll turn your room upside down to try to find that key Did I miss anything?
Nah don't need to go crazy for the key. I'll find it eventually. Just grab it if it's on the table or sth...

I have no idea how piazza turned into reseller
?
I got this creepy ass dream where we had a connecting balcony between our rooms and you just came into my room pulped a chair and just waited for me to wake up
lol

I can neither confirm nor deny whether I could have done that

are you in the library?
I just biked back home cause I fucking forgot to put my code in the right file to print

Do you need me to print something
Yeah just shared with you

They are certifying tours 

New Kowshit n Captain Ignorance
Who's certifying??
Diksha n Ulrikke
Go act like a tourist and ask tough things
They walked too fast 

I also have shit to do 
Lol
I got it working but it's too slow for now. Might need a look up table.

Trying not to look at Schafer's code :v
Haven't thought about it too much yet
yeah
Probably will start tomorrow
i see
Knowing me that is
I wonder how many ppl saw his code... Maybe it's a trap :v
hahah

Maybe he was just careless
Pretty sure there will be some fuckers who'll str8 up copy his code, maybe change var names...

Then schafer could ask him to explain the code... #rip
**cough cough** Prabhat
Kow...
Or I could go... Hey prabhat here is the code in Python since I'm doing c++ I don't need it
Nigga...

"Where did you get the code from?" "Harsha gave it to me" "Bs he used C++"
lol Exactly!! And I'll just pull a poker face and say naw son
You can head home after tennis. I have a meeting a 7 and afterwards most likely gonna pogo (for a while, i have 0 pokeballs)

It works 
And by it you mean...
Mean I'm done. Code's on github. Check if you can see a 'trollgame' pull request as well.

The bike's fucked again... Completely flat back tire...
Well you've always got those two legs...

Or a few fingers to type a message to tell me to pick you up
Nah I'll walk
Legs it is...

I've put the chicken and rice out for ya
"It's Jenny from admissions!! Can you and Harsha pick up from Russell 47 instead or the west gym?  Academic locations changed last minute!!!"

You can practically hear her voice...

Could you check out the bike by Wright if you have time?
Yeah I can do that

Duc Duc Duc.... Chile posted on his timeline in Facebook Just one line, but I'd like a DucVu review

Filled your bike with air

I'll head out in a minute

I couldn't sleep... I coded nimcala in C++ again. I think I'm getting the right result, but it keeps showing only one answer for the win or lose

Come to the side door facing Gilchrist

A is shit faced and getting her to stop nudging me every time is getting harder and harder, cause I'm running out of places to go to
Huh
She keeps ending up standing next to me wherever I go... I'm keeping another friend as a barrier
Who? Ohhhhh Fuck
Yes yes Let's say she pregame more than I did and she doesn't have a good tolerance like me
Like wtf is Anna doing in Cedar Falls 
i know right
Oh shit
I don't think I would care at this point if Anna kept nudging... I'm pretty sure I'm fine with that
Didn't realize she's still in tennis
Yeah... She's pakka drunk

And I've had a good amount but nowhere near drunk as her
Walk to the end of the room See if she follows Rinse and repeat
I've been to like 6 ends of the room I feel...

Now I'm jus sitting down and a friend of mine has her pre occupied
Are you sure she's drunk or acting drunk? 
Let's please go with drunk....

She's pakka drunk... She just sat on the coffee table which happens to be a table with a mirror on it... She sat on it and it broke

As bad as that is, it's good news for me... She's drunk
How is that good news?
I pakka know that she's not acting drunk...

Well it's not good news for the guy who owns the mirror... But for me it's fine
Wtf is this pakka bs
Pakka = Definitely in Indian slang
Vcl Acronym meaning "Holy shit" in Vietnamese slang
Literally that's just three random letters for me
Yours = 5
Fair enough...

But I guess we know now... I'll know what you mean when you say that
I never say that To whom would I say that? 
Umm idk...maybe me
It's fogging so hard can't see Latham from Wright
 I just got home...let me know if you need a ride
Nah just gonna pogo a bit then walk the bike home
okay boss...
U home?
No... I'm still puppy sitting until Keniese comes back... 
Kk. I'm still stuck here with UID.
What's up?
Just wondering if i shld head home to cook
I'm going to be studying... So I'll probs get home only at like 11 or something
k
So nothing basically

Did I get signed up for anything?
No I assume you want to neither skip class on Friday nor wake up at 7 on Saturday.
Very much no...
Kristi handed out a bunch of contacts of prospective students from India

But if you still wanna help Bryant just email him directly
Well isn't this the best day to skip

Funny you should mention that... I'm already helping him

Hey I don't feel too good... I'm gonna be skipping class, just take an extra of anything they give out... I'll try to come to Shaw's class

Got my ass to campus now cause my calendar reminder me that I have a freaking interview today

I'm taking the car to tennis
"Don't feel too good", he said
Hey I need something to do... Can't sit at home the whole time

Do you want me to leave the car on campus for you?

Just a heads up, since you hardly ever look at your phone intend up writing messages for you and sticking it on the door... But me on the other hand make sure I look at all the important stuff, so when you need to tell me something just do us both a favor and just message it to me... If you don't want me to reply to that, just put that in the bloody message as well... Thanks
K
Hey I'm sorry I kinda flipped out earlier... I'm just having a tough few days... I'll clean them fridge when I get back home later tonight...

Hey I need to get away from everything and clear my head... I'm gonna be at the Reese's tonight...

Also they've invited you and me both for dinner on Sunday. Let me know if that works for you

Hey does the dinner plan with the Reese's work out for you or nah?

I've realised that listening to cowshit talk can give me cancer
I honestly wasn't paying attention when you were rambling abt arizona, alaska, whatevs...

It just now dawns on me
lol ok

Well whatever was on your mind at the time was real important then
R u still on campus?
Nah got back home a few mins ago...ssup
I kinda don't feel like doing stuffs tonight. I might just finish this reflection then go home.
Come on home then... We can have a party
If you r free, look up a few options of breakfast/dinner for Friday. We both know we usually take forever to decide on a place
On the way to UoI?
N back, yes

It might just be fast food, but have them rdy
Aight

Also I'm thinking Chinese or Mexican tonight... Preferences?
I prefer Colombian...

Too soon?

AI hw6 is a bitch. Schafer and I had to debug his code.
Well I can try to get some coffee

I'm still working on getting my actions
Combinatorics hw16 Q5 "How did you do it?"

Is "I wrote a Python script" good enough
Who?? CP 10?
CP 10 wrote a script ... 
As in something that'll work on a computer or a script as in now his whole life is going to follow a script
Are you actually retarded? Read my msg again
Oh... hahahaha I didn't read the one in the middle

Question: So in the startingState, do I have to have objects in all caps or does normal casing work Ex- MIDDLE2 or Middle2
He changed the hw description this afternoon after I bugged him with debugging

Heh 

And, it's Middle2 now
Goodness gracious..let us have a chance dammit
That debugging has to be done and, so you're welcome 
Yes yes...

And as always, Thank You

What does it mean when it says there are no valid binding for pre conditions
It couldn't find that predicate in your startingState
"ERROR: Dr. Schafer's assumptions about binding matches may be invalid"
i know right
fml

I'm pretty sure it's because of how I've implemented it
Lmao what :))

I didn't even see that code this afternoon

That's some freaky shit 
hahahaha "freaky shit" lost it completely
Legit thought you made that error up
Wow... spend more time on doing a html doc that shows up like that eh
Inspect element, edit something...

There's an easy way you could do that with Chrome
You've put way too much thought got that

I don't feel like getting up, how cold is it outside?
Warm af
Well fuck... Can't even give that as a reason
Im going back to sleep
Lol... I heard you come in...

Well nighty night

It didn't work before, because of the way my predicates were lined up in my starting state!!

I basically just sat in a 20 min lecture class

I want my peaceful lunch back!!!

Good thing I don't owe him any hw

Okay I'll start out here... I'll come to the library lot

Cowshit is as dumb as you can get in Poleksic's class... I asked an abstract question about an algorithm... Everybody got it and we moved on 10 minutes later, he asks the same question but with so many specifics with the given example and confuses most of the class and himself Stupidity at its best!!!I felt bad for Poleksic and I answered it myself but with no fucks to giveI'm pretty sure he thought I was asking him to shut up, but at that point I wasn't 10 seconds later, I was
 maybe he just wants to be as cool as you 

asking abstract algorithm question n shit 
right

I got our Chicago parking figured out

You on campus and heading home soon?

If you want new shoes, or want to buy me some
80% sure these are literally made in VN :v
nice

Then buy them cheaper and make a profit
pretty sure I can buy them for ~$40
If it's that cheap you should get a pair for me

Continue the drug trade back as well
Sell some 25-cent voodoo shit from VN for $10

I was sitting in the library when I saw this... Lost it and burst out laughing
Why tf is that guy Indian

The mirror arrived
There are donuts in class

Do you still have those AAA batteries?
Maybe. Check my bag
K thanks
so is that rice coming or will I have to kill a nigga to get it
Well texted her like an hour ago and the rice is coming...at 10 tho

Should I just go to her place and see if I can steal some?
this is why niggas in africa r dying
hahaha

That and air strikes
Anything you want to print from the library?

Itinerary, boarding pass, last will and testament?
Shit you want me to die eh...

I was going to o do it, but if you're there I'll send it

Don't rush. 30-40 mins would be fine

Cool
On the way?
I'm at the roundabout by maucker

How long does he chicken stay longer?
You should pick up a controller (preferably wireless) for casual-couch-gaming
What kind of a controller?
I have a logitech f710. Sth similar. Assuming it's cheaper in india?
I can get a redgear for 20 bucks
Never heard of it

I'm laughing as hard and as much as I can so that I can stop myself from mentioning "women drivers" when I returnn

you should do the same
Thank you

That was my first thought...and I just kept thinking that with every sentence I was typing

Nah bruh She alive but car is rekd

So you is fine

Yep pakka female driver Doing speed limit or less And such a beautiful crash

You have no idea how glad I am that we didn't give her the keys to your car

Cause not only would the car have been rekt

But we both would have one less friend

It's kinda weird that I went virtually alcohol free this semester
Hey don't blame me, I tried
Less than a week in VN...alr 2 "get-together"
Not very hard, but still

ha
At least 2 more scheduled next week
That's the way...get drunk and make me proud All my idiots have semester exams... So no real "get-together" yet

Alr had the game

I swear these Asians can't play cs. At all.
You're just much better

What's average skill level
I just need win 4 consecutive arms race game

What do u think?
Alrighty, so it's a bunch of shitty silvers
No I never joke 
Send me suggestions for the wireless controller, and I'll get something... Some are cheaper here as you suggested
There's a logitech f710 lying around in my house and I bought another dual shock 4. Good alternative could be an xbox controller (which works for pc)
She just put one word as his fb status...and no one lost their minds... "Fuck"
Huh? Who?
Fucking autocorrect

Not she, I meant Shaw
"I forgot to enter the grades"

"I want you to meet xyz. You two go talk to each other"

Dreadful
So when and where's the wedding
Bitch this kid's 12

I know I'm 16 but wtf

Your mom needs her grandkids

She's thought this whole thing through
This shit's weird
But the good news is that, maybe she's given up on H
My friend's kid
This is your time to introduce J

Wait wut This kinda feels fucked up
My mom's friend's kid That shit's too cray
How old is this kid

And is the kid a female??
She's 12 looking like 15

Ive had a few shots but still
Well I think it's time you drop the mic and scram

Before you commit any illegal things especially considering that you've had a few
haha

My mom's here with her friends

Literally just acting as her chauffeur
I'd never have expected to hear that
Hear what?
You becoming the driver
Well I'm the most alcohol tolerant around here

Inb4 "I never expect that" 
I was gonna say

Sure sure
My liver's still the youngest so... 

Well not younger than the 12 year old

But still
Actually it's the 12 year olds

Yes yes

Does the kid drink yet??
No...?

In other news my new visa arrived today so I'm good for the trip back

In other other news There's a slight possibility that J's coming over next weekend *slight* _possibility_
Is this in the same event of the fuckers reunion??

"I'm a nice guy" 
I will stay away as long as possible

Oh wow I'm impressed

Should I skip the Personal Wellness lab at 1?
The winter skills one?
Yea. Should I?
Yep....

There's not enough snow to learn proper skills
Why am I asking Harsha whether I shld skip class
Cause I give the right reasons for such cases
Ofc u had to inject that bs

You know how gullible ppl are 
Si senor

Please play along

This is probably my x saving grace for this morning
So I drove back to CF yesterday?

Or did I stay the night in Chicago and are now on the way back?
You are already in CF

You can say you came back early this morning or last night...Your wish
What is she talking abt?
The fuck is wrong with CF weather
Bitch ass CF welcoming us

U going for gray class?
Yeah... And then I'm coming home and finding something to eat and then deciding if I want to crash or just exhaust myself more
Wing Tuesday

I also need a pick up at 4 30 from WRC
Lol okay... I was surprised that you didn't take the car

So you're going to the HPELS class
Yea

Up to you whether you wanna invite Spain Idiot
It's your car and your cash that's buying me food...I'm just the chauffeur who gets treated very well
But you started this charade of Harsha-still-stuck-in-Chicago
Sure we can invite her...I didn't expect that to stick but guess she is a blonde after all
I'm screenshotting this shit 
I'm gonna die much earlier than my due date aren't I
You should be glad that you're still alive

So should I
What is she? A blood sucking German Shepherd that we need to be that worried?
Screenshotting another... 
I'm just putting more of myself in the grave that I dug long back

Did you invite her?
Ya
okay boss what time?
After I'm done with this. So 4 15 ish.
okay boss
HPELS ended so I'm just gonna walk home. Get some sleep

You're not wrong about Spain Idiot being too eager to meet people...
She is in the union
If you somehow can get the car to start and drive that piece of shit to campus that would be great. If you do, don't lock the doors. I need that red package in the front seat.
Do you want me to leave the key in the glove box or something?
Up to you I just want the package
Kay

Cars not gonna start, I'm leaving to the ITTC now, I'll just get that with me
K I'm still in ITTC
Where you at
Nigga just get to class
Oh also she was very upset with you last night because you cancelled on pie

I forgot to message it earlier
good job "Passive aggressiveness"
Same thing even now when I said I should just have stayed in the library
R u in Gray's class?
Yep I just saw you walked by
Yeah was trying to see where u at?
In the back
Done?
Just

You around or out?
In student lounge

Did you txt Manju for his car?
I did, but he doesn't have jumper cables...
Well a) we can try our current cables to see if they work b) go to John's and return the charger and borrow cables or c) get new ones from Walmart.

Either way we need the car running today or early tmr

Actually we don't *need* the car but we definitely need a Hyvee run
Yes... I'll give Carol a call
We kinda do need the car, coz I doubt Spain Idiot's gonna walk to and from her apt. We can get Manju to pick her up, but we all rmb last time when manju caught wind of a Fuckers Gathering
No, I'm gonna call them to get us jump started and then also get the charging cable for battery starter

She didn't pick the call, I'll try again in a bit

Is she even gonna come around

When are you gonna get home??
An hour ago
Are you going to be home till evening?

Jon may come over sometime between now and then
Cool

Jon came over

Jump started the battery. I'm letting the engine run for a few minutes
I'm in my way home now

But yes that's the thing to do

Where you at??
Pasta aisle

If you rate how organized our apt as a 10

J's apt would be a soft 2
I swear I would never have thought that

Sai manju and a few others are here... 121 e street... There's also cancer, so I wouldn't suggest coming over

Not that you're not having a good time anyways...

Are you from Hanoi or from the hcmc area?
Hanoi
There's bread and eggs for you on the table
Thanks I was alr in the lab tho
Oh... I heard you coughing and saw the light on in your room, so I thought you were taking a day off

Cheapest one I found... Also Walmart has battery testing services as well

I'm going to be on Poleksic's class till maybe about 4:45
Heh. Should be fun
Poleksic started his class by telling a kid, sorry but if you miss class again, you might as well drop it Classic poleksic

I don't think we're going battery shopping today
Yeah that's ok

If you have office hours you should have that printed out somewhere

"Miss class = gg"
You going to CC
No grab some pizza
I was gonna ask you to do that...
I'm still helping a student in Data Structures
I got home as soon as I sent that

She's going to mepo this weekend There's BBQ chicken on the counter, I forgot to cover it... I won't be back until atleast 9

Did you get home, if yes, is the chicken fine?
Where the fuck is the goddamn laundry keycard?
No idea... Couldn't find it either

Laundry card is on the table, it was under all the papers on the table
Unless you're global elite you should shut the fuck up
Well I'm sorry that I woke you up

Are you having issues with the internet in the apartment, specifically your laptop. Imma probs call Mediacom later tonight
