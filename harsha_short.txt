Vokay boss
Ffs

Why the fuck why
Why she cut her hair...?
Why all of em did
Who is all of them

What did they do

What is happening
face palm

Let me rephrase

Why do girls cut their hair and effectively downgrade themselves from a 8.5 to a 5.7?
That I do not know

And I actually have strong feelings against it

But she ain't mine, so I can't do anything...

But you're potential ones both have short hair now
Even if she were yours

Yeah

Fuck shit fuck
If she was mine there would be a very long conversation happening
Obligatory
Well shit Duc, what's happening to your potential love lives... there going down from an 8.5 to 5.7

Not argument there
On a brighter note, Humble Bundle's offering $15 for Sid Meier's Civilization V	$30NBA 2K16	$60Mafia II: Digital Deluxe	$40Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel	$40and*Battleborn*	$60	released May 3

Now actually

PoGo l8r More lures
Okay I'll join in like 10-15 mins... reduce the damn TV volume

Oh...

Interesting

New video out by soviet
Damn...I just called Hillside and they said I could move in Monday. If only I could move in tmr we could have had the entire apt for the _party_

What time do you usually go to work?
Well damn

Why?
Nah scrap that

We could move in after you're done with work

I was thinking if I move in tmr I could ride with you to Waverly, drive back, spend the day move as much stuffs as I can and we can move the rest when I pick you up in the afternoon

But that plan fell thru it seems
Well we can do that, I don't care... why did it fall through?
I can't move in tmr yet

Monday
Oh yeah... duh

Well alright, time to start getting your shit packed up

Did you get the keys and what not?

Also do we want to join A and Bre for the movie at seven
I'm thinking

Considering
Well if not we can go to the later one or Waterloo theatre

Let's do 7 at Waterloo, they have it playing in the dream lounge chairs

Well now that I think of it, we can do the drop me, move stuff and pick me up plan on Monday...

Movie at 7, I'll come at 6:20
Cool

I'm tidying up the room a bit

if you have $1 in quarters that'd be great
Well you started early

Yeah there's some in the car and I have a box of coins in my room, I'll stop by quick and get it
it's too fucking hot

I took the afternoon off
I'm in the room just casually sitting and not creeping on you...hopefully you don't have a heart attack when you wake up

I think alcohol keeps me up... it's like my caffeine

And for some reason, I have body pains
I woke up at 10, made some pasta so I'd have some food in my stomach, then conked out until now
If you'd still like to start shifting, I can come on my lunch break and move a load to the house and you can drop me off and do the same. And then in the evening, me and Jon can get the van and a trailer to start moving the couch, the bed and tables and all.
I just called them and they wont be ready for me until 2

so I'll get the keys and we can start moving after you get done with work
Alrighty
I need the Reese's address
2318 Greenwood Avenue..

Why?
Nvm

Scrap that i don't need it anymore
Well it's there if you need it, just let me know if you're going to be using it so I can let them know

I'll be home in the next 30 mins... text me when your ready and I'll see when Jon is ready
Can you come to ROTH?

Fuckers gave me a key that doesn't work

Im going back there
Yep

I'll be there in like 25-30 mins
The new key works

117 F street
Be there in 3-4 mins
So basically just grab anything you can. The tv box is in the supply closet next to the bathroom. The bean bag chair and the computer desk is good to go.
Yes boss

Take your time
On my way
Roughly when shld I start driving to pick u up?
I'm going to say like 3:45-4

Make sure the AC works please
I might just take a nap

Goddamn

All's left at HV are uncategorized shit
And wake up in time, RIGHT?

Wasn't that all that was left even yesterday

Oh your clothes and all were there

I remember I remember

Okay I'm done...I'm not getting anything more done... you might as well start your journey to come pick me up

Please tell me that you're not dead asleep!!
Eh

I thought u said 4

So I set the alarm to 4

I'm coming 
I'M. DYING. IN. ALL. THIS. UNPRODUCTIVITY. AND. SLEEPINESS
Im at that roundabout

North entrance
Coming
We have Internet

We had a shitty splitter and cable so we got virtually no signal
hahahaha

Im remembering when you said, this cable looks so good
Well i was right

That's why the tv works

Not the router

We used a shitty black cable for the router
Alright alright

hahahaha

Oh okay
#notracist
I thought it was the other way round

Round 1 goes to the white

#NotRacisitAsWell
Bad news is we can't change the wifi ssid or password

Doing so requires subscriber info
Why not?
Which i believe is DoR
Oh... I guess that kinda makes sense then

Im still trying to get over black and white and interracial jokes right now
I'm glad we didn't discuss this in public

might get shot
hahahaha
#alilracist
I don't think you're wrong there

Or just keep Russel around for a body shield when bullets start flying and then mourn for his loss and then make a joke about how we don't have to keep seeing him and then the other goes, "too soon dude, too soon"
I'm not so sure abt that

he's alr haunting UNI rn
hahahaha

So there's no getting away from him eh
why do you think we shld graduate asap =))

well, to get jobs n shit

but also Russel :v
Motivation to get a job is moving away from Russell
very true

did you talk to Jon abt the vacuum and the tv stand?
I talked to him about the TV stand... he said he doesn't know what he's upto in the evening, but if he's free he can come. I showed him a picture and he thinks we can fit that in the car
Ivy?
I'll send a message to Carol about the vacuum

Yep
ok

our afternoon is kinda packed

1. Grab the rest of the stuff from HV and vacuum / clean 2. Drop me off back at Hillside to give A her stuffs3. Grab the tv stand4. Walmart
Alright then... I'll get off as soon as possible. Workday is pretty packed as well.I've got 3 meetings for the day left and update report on my current project
yeah I'll leave you to it
Someone fucked up while putting my application in Production so I have to find a way to correct it whatever the fault is

So I'm thinking right now it may be a lil after 4

But we'll see
yup

A said she'll come at 5-530

we'll see
Alrighty
last thing

"According to our records, the contract that you signed had the wrong date. Instead of signing a 2017 contract, we had you sign a 2015 contract. The first pages of the contract state that it is a 2016-2017 contract, however the last two page where you signed state that the contract ends May 31 2015."

just got an email from Hillside

goes well with the "why are people around me always fuck up" theme we're having today
I don't know if I'm laughing cause I find this funny or because no one can do the o e job that they are supposed to do

You're on your own with A, I'm getting off work a lil late, just got a new project and need to sit and discuss

I'll get the vacuum cleaner and come

Bryant has a meeting set up for which I'm attending apparently it at 5:15PMSo on my way I'll drop off the vacuum and then go there...After that I'll give Jon a call and he'll get the van and come over there and pick up the desk and then drop off at Hillside and then get that there and we can go to Walmart
Cool

So ive gathered all of my stuffs

But i can't get the vacuum cleaner

To work

Also

Apparently they dont want the tv stabd that we have rn

So...

Found it
I got the shower stuff... Where you at
The tvs
Sleep is hitting me like a damn wrecking ball trying to take me down
Yup

Am wandering around campus while waiting for hv office to open
Needless to say, you're playing P-GO eh
I'd be a zombie if i am not

There is a guy named Oldguy919 driving a golf carts all around campus taking gyms :))

He is, in fact, old

Checked out from HV

Manager's words when I mentioned the missing keys

"dont worry honey ya good"
Everyone should try to aim to be him

Well that's good news for you

Did she say, who lost the key?
Idk

I turned in my key then so that's prolly why

Goddamn it

Wtf was Kristi doing at ITC

She went "He's alive!"

Which ofc means "you'll be dead soon"
Bwahahahahahha.... Yeah she did that to me too. I played it cool and talked my way out of getting any work from her
Me too

I swiftly diverted to asking her abt Jorge
hahahaha

I feel like that's the safest option of getting oyt
ahaha

the microwave's MC's :v

i know for a fact he didn't buy it

lol he just fb msg'd me

if you have my microwave pls bring it to [his new address]

worst case scenario: we have to look for a different microwave and this one goes to the dumpster 
Or we can hide it in our backyard if he comes looking and he'll be gone and we'll still have it

And I may have found a bed
just the frame or with mattress?
With the mattress
$?
0
lol

gitit

we prolly need Jon...again tho

damn
Yep

We're outside
My mom wanted to go on a lil vacation when im back

And insists on inviting H

running
And these best mom of the year that just made her son cringe so hard that he might have puked on the inside goes to......
somehow she still believes that H and I can work things out...

I briefly considered telling her I alr had a new gf...
You should tell her that you've moved on from that alphabet and onto the next one

Nope...you don't, you have a potential one
there is no J in the VNese alphabet...
Well whatever sounds like J then

Use GI
holy shit

G-H-I-J
Didn't see that coming

Well there goes my theory on skipping letters for you
there is still a K between J and L
You can take "mine"
nope no thank you

absolute savage
And they say one man can't start a war
I think I should volunteer for at least a few of those...

start work day a lil later...

also Sasha is an RA?!
Yep

Bender Hall
she gon die...

esp when it's Bender
Just keep your phone display always on and then keep it in your pocket and do the tour. Prolly can hatch them eggs
lmao 
She gonna find out
Hold on ppl there's a Lapras nearby I gotta catch this brb...
Hell Yeah
I swear if I get a group of all hs kids playing PoGo...

Or I could be like "I will take anyone here from Team Valor"

we gon conquer this bitch
Both team Red and Yellow walk towards you
Now that I think about it

that could be our latest UNI selling point

in a 10 minute walk you have 4 gyms and 20+ pokestops

you cant have that shit at ISU
hahahaha

But will it be a 10 min walk then?
if you dont catch anything in between yeah

otherwise more like 15
We're going to be losing a lot of kids on tours starting this semester

They just wander off cause they find a spearow
potentially

"On your right we have McCollum Science Hall, we have a polar bear and two alligators..." "Yeah yeah yeah can we reach those pokestops from our class?"
True that
Sm fcker alr taking our Lang gym 
Well that was fast
So i was walking around when this random faculty guy asked me "Do you need help finding anything?"

I almost went "yeah, this bulbasaur has been on my radar since forver"

Then I realized that might not be what he meant by "find something"
Him: Can I help you find something You: This Bulbasaur Him: Right this way takes you to Bulbasaur's location UNI Feedback: The staff and faculty are very kind and helpful, they go out of their way to help the students find what they need to be successful

So I can't find the app... I haven't searched a lot, but since you already have it, just send me the API if you still have it or tell me the name of the file or give me it's location
I'm so glad I didn't sign up for tour today
That boring eh
that hot
Lol
at least yesterday was cloudy and cool
It's going to be hot in Thursday too

Just checked

Friday will be cooler

Also it might rain on Thursday
I have half a mind to make some excuses for tmr
Going out of town....?
"I have a doctor appointment for color blindness"

Totally legit
That's a thing right
It can be if I want it to be 
Idk what I prefer

Tour group that doesn't talk

Or tour group that asks too much my throat's drying up from answering

The latter, obviously
hahahaha

That's my kinda group
One of the dads was poGoing the whole way

Look at all these PokeStops

Then his wife hit him
PoGo dad for the win

hahahaha

Typical
It's too fucking hot tho

This polo does not breath. At all

I might just go home after lunch
Lol.. that hot huh

And today is the coolest day of the week
Probably, but with mouth drying up and me trapped ib this Hazmat suit I feel

Its like a desert
hahahaha

Hazmat suit, I'm going to remember that one
Holy shit

There's Pokemon on Netflix?!
You didn't know!!!???

We can watch it together if you'd like

I already watched all of it, but I don't mind watching it again

I'll probs be singing the song and everything...become the small kid that I am
fuckin hell

I still have all those Star Trek to watch...
The old ones??
as much as I can, probably
I'll wait patiently
storm's coming

looks like alien invasion from the apt
That's the kind of weather you make some hot chocolate, and sit back and watch TV

At least for me

Storms a brewing

I just remembered, Suicide Squad releases today
Lol

Perfect weather eh
I sware, I love this weather. I'm casually sitting out and enjoying the weather. They have other guests and all of them are talking

#ImNotAntiSocial
Yeah well as long as you're not stuck in the rain i think everyone can enjoy thia
Yep

Say what do you think about movie later in the night

I checked the timings

They have late night shows as well

Waited half an hour for some fuckers to show up taking clothes out of washer
Are you "stuck"
What do you think smart ass

Watching dota

Praise ITS for installing 2 computers here
We're going to have dinner in a bit, but if you get super bored, message me. I can head over
Yup

not gonna lie,  I just finished dinner, so fucking full, and _might_ pass out any minute now
Also before 9:20

All time low

I still have all 5 gyms
Now you're just making me feel bad
U could drive by n grab sm of them

Every one but the Campanile

Lang gym is full
Took 3 of them with drive bys
I saw a Dratini the 1x evolved one over at the Dome earlier. Drove 3 laps all around the parking lots. Nothing.

Then I saw a Pikachu on the way to WRC just now.

Tour's starting in 10. Im legit depressed rn

And by "saw" I mean it appeared in my Nearby

Its silhouette.
I'm pretty sure the temp at work is like 75, but I sware I'm just shivering here, I feel like I'm at 30 or 40 degrees

I caught a beedrill
Oh shit

Do you have a cold?
I don't know... Massive headache and then the chills

Heading to Campanile to take a gym and stretch my legs

Well I'm back in the apartment and there's no sign of you

Give me a list of those PTC accounts and the password

Fair enough
U home?
Yep

Ssup
Few things

1. Charge your phone

2. Found your battery pack yet?
Yep
3. Pick me up near the gym by CBB at abt 5 45

4. Take a picture of the fridge board so we can go to walmart
I have a meeting for ISA from 5:30 to 6:30
Oh lol
At sidecar
K ill PoGo while waiting for u then
I can give you the car keys and you can go shopping and come back, and then after I'm done we can start farming and then go hunting

How's that for a plan
How abt dinner?
We can do late night, or I'll just buy us some sandwiches from sidecar

Whichever

Or hell we can do a drive through when we're hunting
That works 

K send me the shopping list

See u in 30
Alright...
Which brand of cereal?
Anything

You're still shopping??
Yea
Alright, I just got done

Lemme know when you're heading back
you up?
Yes, I am up
I know who the morning neutralizer is

Motherfucking water bottle guy

Oh lol that wasnt zen

Coz its yellow
Schweinsteiger if I got the spelling right has been offered to Juventus
lol

I'm surprised they didnt just include him as part of the Pogba deal
It almost feels like they're just saying, here, if we haven't compensated enough, we'll even give you a good player
nah they won't give him away for free

and they bought him for 6.5 mil so it's not that big a deal

with Pogba United's having way too many MF :v
I wonder how many are going to have to keep taking a seat
Mata, Blind, Rojo,...

Ill prolly leave work early in an hour. Maybe take a nap. If im still sleeping when u get home wake me up and we can go to the 4 45 show
Alrighty
u up?
Yep

Facebook it

Can't see images on WhatsApp

Okay make me some PTC accounts and send them my way...
I don't rmb if I had put the pork stew out for thawing. Do that when u get home if i hadn't done that alr

I'll be back in a few...after collecting more pokeballs

hahahaha

Try to get the bike from Alia and Jon soon

there's a loop of ~3 miles

that'll net us all 10 gyms

:)
Alrighty... I'll get on it

Make me those accounts...

The meeting that I'm in is soooo boring
denhatanhhung denhianhhung detamanhhung detuanhhung denguanhhung delucanhhung dethatanhhung debatanhhungdecua nhhungdethapanhhung ---- pw nxhfr58e

let me know if those work

I wrote a python script to create them :v
I can't access it through the wifi. Also do these accounts have to be logged in and then accept the tetma and stuff?
Pretty sure they do
Ready when you are
I just realized that Russel could deduce from your fb post that you live with me now and not MC.

Otherwise he's dumber than we thought 
Dumber
I AM SPRINTING

OUT OF WORK

scanner picked up an omastar

near our apt

like wtf!
Fuck me

Why does it happen when we aren't in our house!!!!!!

Go get it
we have 2 eggs left

How the actual fuck

Blu guy here

Heading to Lang

Looping back after

Brenda 31035935406

Where r u?

Whenever u r ready

Library closing in 15
I swear, waking up early  shouldn't be allowed on weekends

The game kicked me out...and I can't even get in now
Get in the game?

Or the gym?

Magikarp same spot

Wigglypuff a block away on main. 14 mins
We lost the CBB gym
Train these 2. Wiggly. Seerley. Reclaim campus.
There's a bunch of blue team guys going and taking the gyms now
Lol sure we'll neutralize them at night

Also taking gyms at 1pm is just plain stupid

Hope they like getting roasted

How's the check up?
Good... 90% healed up
Gr8 

U going to work after that?
Already at work...

Bored and ready to sleep

I might take an early day today
like home-after-lunch early?
hahahaha

Don't worry about cooking... I'll probably crash

Woke up at 5:30 again

Saw your notes

And then just went back and did nothing
so you didnt get the gyms?

also arent we getting ice cream and having dinner at piazza?
Well I left the house at like 7:15

So couldn't get it by then

And yes we're getting ice cream...

I thought we'd be waiting till like the first week of classes for actual food at the dining centers
hmm so we

are just gonna drop off the ice cream after they have dinner
That was the plan in my head

Tell Felix to tell those kids not to have desert and then we come in and save the day
well if you can figure a way to catch em all like Pokemon
haha

Well we have the flavor list and we have to get eggs anyways

So we can go to hyvee maybe and stock up

Buy a bag of ice and put it in the cooler and then put all the ice cream in there
well you can do all that then pick me up at CBB

then we can go to hyvee

what time should you be back? sounds like you need ample napping time :v
Well do I want it, Yes Do I need it, not really

I'll send you a massage after I get my life figured out
*if you get... 
You're not completely wrong there

Can you call Brenda and yell her that we'll come get the couch tonight at like 5 PM
Yell?

That seems rude 
Yeah you know like shout in the phone

Well she has your couch
"Bitch we coming to take your shit!"
More like, "Please step off bitch, Thank You"

That way we're not too harsh
She didn't pick up

I'll try again later

She will be home
Wonderful
So what's the plan? We need 1) the SUV to get 2) the sofa, then hyvee for 3) ice cream. Also 4) i need to cook, kinda want to PoGo earlier tonight
I'm still waiting for the damn car, should be here soon. Get car, get sofa, give car to Bryant for a while, get groceries, head to the group, give ice cream, come back eat and then pogo
"Come back eat"

Nigga u wut? 
And eat
Eat what?
Umm whatever you cooks

Or whatever foods we get
I can go with you to get the sofa n groceries then I will be back to clean n cook while you give the kids ice cream

Come back eat
Why am I giving the kids the ice cream....

You're the elder one
Cos bitch you can't cook 

Or won't cook 
Fair enough, I'll give the kids the ice cream,and come home and eat

By which time you better have my dinner ready
Sure 

Also

Whose SUV r u waiting for?
Sai's
N who has it rn?
Some Pakistani
K. Please come rescue me as soon as you have it

I didn't know the orientation sessions r in CBB
haha
Im stuck here with the like of Alisha Eugene and Danusha
Say no more... I'm en route with Ivy
Take the parking lot by Russel

The Hall not the cancer
I is here
Brenda just called me
On my way there
Most of them were alr gone. Fuck it imma just head home. We could dump this with Danusha and she could give them out at breakfast or sth
Your call
Yeah im still in a general pissy mood so prolly best to avoid talking to ppl
Kay

Tell me what the joke is that she sent

And we can do something nice when I'm back
No problem, just hoped everything was ok. Maybe you got jacked or something. You probably will going back though when all the jealous people see your new furniture

Weird sense of humor, but ok

Will you need me to pick you up from Bryant's? Im heading out to nuke some gyms
I'm heading to pointe west
K omw
Where you at
Im here. Just making sure you're not hiding behind a bush or sth
Did you decide to go to work
Nope im cleaning the apt

No-shoe-inside policy is now in effect
Alright...

haha

I wonder how long that's gonna last
That's not a challenge you fucker

Damn I blame Anna for our liberal usage of that word
I blame her too

How is she...maybe I'll send her a message

Nah...you can find out and tell me
"hey how are you"

?

That sounds weird
"I'm fine"
-- End of conversation -
Wouldn't be

Surprised

Also side note, I'm thinking about growing my hair long
do you have a good reason for that?
Umm... Do I need to?
Not really, but I was hoping you had one
Also second side note, my chocolate pudding is sugar free.... FML

Well I can come up with one if that'll make you happy
By growing your hair would you look more like an idiot? 

#ripformatting

*Y
haha
Fucking whatsapp
And *N

Reason: Since I want to surprise my mom, just go completely looking like a new person...
Then nah don't do that it's a bad idea

just make sure she wouldn't call the cops on you
Well I'm sure she won't... I'll probably reach in daytime...so go surprise her and then immediately go get a haircut... Much cheaper in India

Okay well then you give me a reason to grow my hair long
make sure you pay the barber extra when you get that hair cut :v

he might just bring out the lawnmower

when the acid kicks in...
Why... He'll probs be thanking me that he got to cut soo much hair
motherfucker invented the dab at 2:06
Varma: I just watched the whole video twice and showed it to my colleagues...  I haven't watched or heard that song in years
so it's an actual Indian classics :v
